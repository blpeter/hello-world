# hello-world

Hello,

My name is Ben Peterson and I have been working in the IT field since 1998. 
I started out with a small ISP and now I support the Computer Science Department at Boise State University.

I decided that I should find a better way to record the knowledge I find through my wanderings.

Fun fact, I was on a team that competed in the IGVC competition in college. Our robot was named Urckbot. Here is a video of our robot in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWMBObGXcSY
